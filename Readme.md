This Project in Machine Learning is aimed at detecting whether a twitter profile is bot or not. Starting with feature extraction, we checked the test accuracy of various models like Multinomial Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.

Finally, we chose Random Forest Classifier for the task which gave us an test accuracy over 90% in detecting bots.

The class also took part in a kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/twitter-bot-classification) in which various teams took part and our model secured the third position.
